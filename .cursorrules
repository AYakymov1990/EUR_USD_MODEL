Main language: Python.
Project structure: notebooks/, src/, data/, config/.
Code style: PEP8, snake_case, max line length ~100.
Docstrings required for key functions and classes.
Time series: no shuffling; split train/val/test by time.
Target: y_t = Close_{t+3} / Close_t - 1 (3-bar forward return on M15).
Features: prices/returns, M15 indicators (EMA20, EMA50, RSI14, ADX14, ATR14, EMA20-EMA50), H1 trend flag, etc.
Avoid look-ahead bias: features at time t must use only information <= t.
Base model: simple PyTorch nn.Linear for regression, MSE loss, Adam/SGD.
Notebooks: keep pipeline and plots, move heavy logic into src/ modules.
Comments and markdown explanation in Russian, code identifiers in English.
Prefer interpretability over overly complex models.
